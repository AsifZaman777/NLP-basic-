# NLP using python

## NLP Word Normalization -

Word normalization is a process of converting different forms of a word into a common base form.
Word normalization is a common preprocessing step in many NLP tasks, such as text classification, information retrieval and machine translation.

There are several types of word normalization techniques, including:

- Stemming : Stemming involves removing the suffixes of words to obtain their stem, or base form. Ex=>`runnning, runs and run is run`
- Lemmatization: Lemmatization involves converting words into their base form, or lemma, based on their part of speech. Ex=> `ran,running and runs is run` 
- Case normalization: Case normalization involves converting all characters in a word to a common case, typically lowercase in order ti reduce the variation in word forms.
- Spelling correction: Spelling Correction involves identifying and correcting spelling errors or variation in a text corpus, in order to improve the accuracy of NLP algorithms. 

## NTLK Module -

Natural Language Tool Kit is a popular python library used for natural language processing tasks such as tokenization, lemmatization, parts of speech tagging, parsing and sentiment analysis among others.

NTLK mainly providdes large collection of corpora `text dataset` as well as pre trained models for many natural processing tasks.
