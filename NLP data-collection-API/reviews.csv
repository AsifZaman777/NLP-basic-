All were excellent. Burgers were so huge i could only eat 1/3 of mine and a few Frings. I had to save room for the delectable milk shake. I would come back here just for that!!! Friendly service, small store with seating for around 12 people.  All in all a pretty low/moderately priced burger.",4,"Mission Viejo, CA",2023-04-17T00:00:00.000Z

U0QXjZ8-hCJu771xU6NOPA,"Talk about GOOD food! 
Yes, it's fast food but it is excellent QUALITY burgers and chicken sandwiches, fries, onion rings and shakes! 
My husband loves the extra spicy burger and those ""frings"" and the peanut butter shake, consistently great and tasty food! 
I love their mushroom burger and their classic cheese burger with some sweet potato fries or onion rings, the banana/ Nutella shake is fantastic. 
The veggies are fresh and those sides are absolutely delicious. 
RUN to Pearl's Burgers for an excellently prepared burger!!",5,"San Francisco, CA",2023-04-18T00:00:00.000Z
nnPSTqi9VENlrz4koouu2w,It is truly the best burger I have ever had.  The Phat Bob is amazing.  The burgers are juicy and they put the perfect amounts of cheese and condiments. They also make great shakes.,5,"Bloomington, IN",2023-03-14T00:00:00.000Z
yYP5lEiWgerolktqfLurfQ,"Amazing little burgers at a small spot across the street from our hotel. Limited seating and friendly staff.
Glad we went with the deluxe mini burger with bacon and cheese with a side of fries that were lightly battered. Very delicious and filling.",5,"La Puente, CA",2023-03-22T00:00:00.000Z
5lKEkd7ehzMAgyBGKcT0Pw,"It was just... okay.  I was up in SF (I live in SJ) with some friends for the day and we knew our first stop had to be food.  I was craving a burger, so we found this spot and decided to give it a whirl.  

The food was good, but I wouldn't say it was the best burger I had ever had.  My favorite burger is the bacon-bleu; literally my go to burger order whenever it is available.  And this certainly wasn't the best I had ever had.  What made it not so great was the fact the the bleu wasn't introduced until my last bite, so what I actually got in my last bite was a blast of crumbled bleu cheese.  

I think if you are so hungry you are about to pass out, then go! But, there are better options nearby.",3,"San Jose, CA",2023-03-01T00:00:00.000Z
nxKLl2U23QWNdQjnSmomNw,"Had a few burgers now and they are all excellent, the classic cheese burger was probs my fave. Very quick and kind thoughtful staff. 

Love their garlic fries and milk shakes. Saw someone with the chili cheese fries and now am looking forward to ordering those as well.",5,"San Francisco, CA",2023-01-20T00:00:00.000Z
5QQUV7kvDIlAm1qc029lXg,"I cannot express enough how pretty this place is!! It may be small, but it honestly was the best burger I had. (we went there twice). I had a Pearl's Deluxe with cheese and bacon, hands down. French fries were crispy and tasty. I would love to come back someday. The best burger ever! Small restaurant, with only a few tables. People come and go or eat standing. Very popular. Burgers are huge. French fries are not included in the price. A bit expensive for a snack, but it is worth it!",5,"CA, CA",2022-12-28T00:00:00.000Z
G4l-_ZGb15aidVMwqTnx8A,"We recently grabbed dinner here, and although it's somewhat of a SF staple, it really fell short for me. 

I got the prized pearl, which simply had an overwhelming amount of blue cheese. I do really enjoy blue cheese, but towards the middle of the burger, it felt as if I was just eating bites of blue cheese over and over. The onions were in between raw and grilled (still opaque), so were in a weird state where onion could actually detract from a burger. The patty itself was not well seasoned; just tasted like I was biting into unseasoned cooked beef. By the end, all the juices had flowed out of everything, and I was eating basically slop.

Personally will not be coming back!",2,"San Francisco, CA",2022-07-02T00:00:00.000Z
aPmyjPzlwWCoPPME8qxjHQ,"Stopped in on a Saturday night, food was ready quickly. 
We got the chili cheese dog and cheeseburger.

The food was delicious, we really enjoyed it!",5,"Orange County, CA",2022-07-30T00:00:00.000Z
NfZpdAJLpcGalQvRQpzOpg,"This place always gets 5 stars. By far the best burger in the Bay. I alway get the deluxe with cheese and bacon, and onion rings. The onion rings are fresh cut, and hand breaded. So tasty. With Covid restrictions in place, I find parking, and then place my order through Yelp. It's always ready when I get there. The service is always fast and friendly. I long for the days when I can eat there again with my friends.",5,"San Francisco, CA",2022-07-16T00:00:00.000Z
1VVDdDGAHdof4MZ4_3afFg,"Sweet potato fries.
Prized Pearl burger.
Everything was piping HOT!!! Which was fantastic. There is nothing better than sweet potato fries right out of the cooker!
The burger had the prefect ratio of blue cheese and bacon! No skimping. Everyone was super friendly. They have won a lot of Zaget and trip advisor awards also. My only  complaint was the price of sweet  potato fries for a side with a burger....pretty steep!
I give them 4.5 because of this. Otherwise it would be 5.",4,"Lakeville, MN",2022-09-20T00:00:00.000Z
kFdQbzZeQWkXgXlcH0jG7Q,"Quality burger for a decent price in a small hole in the wall.

I got the pearl deluxe with cheese. If you like plain old American cheeseburgers then there's nothing to complain about. But next time, I think I'll try one of their special burgers to to try something more unique and memorable.

One thing that stands out is their quality. The bun was nicely toasted and the lettuce and onions tasted freshly washed and chopped.

Service was good and the seats and tables were clean. Don't expect much from the decor as it is just a small hole in the wall.",4,"San Francisco, CA",2022-08-01T00:00:00.000Z
nU8WKB20fxARvtQvnDJh-Q,On the door it says amazing little burger joint... It's legit. You walk in to a sprawling board of a menu and right in the middle of everything that Buffalo Burger caught my eye. I don't see it in the menu much in the south east so I went for it. It is $20 but it didn't disappoint. Fantastic burger cooked to order. The fries (or chips as they referred to them)  were a little on the greasy side but still had a nice crunch to them. The bacon and cheese were layered with care on top with the veggies on the bottom with a sesame seed bun. So good.,5,"Miami, FL",2022-07-24T00:00:00.000Z
taQe-pQHIH2lHzy115JLXw,"Pretty good burger by SF standards! (they are hard to come by). I tried the ""Phat Bob,"" which comes with bacon, onion rings, BBQ sauce, cheese, and mayo. Everything was tasty and well-balanced. My only gripe was that the onion rings seemed a bit MIA. The burger itself was juicy and reasonably portioned for the price. I also tried a side of the fries, which are a traditional east coast diner style. They were hot and crispy, exactly what you want from this type of fry. I also tried their Oreo milkshake, which was a bit of a letdown; it was too watery. I will return if I'm in the area looking to get my burger fix!",4,"San Francisco, CA",2022-06-26T00:00:00.000Z
W5DlU4FGl68ooSXJwreEzQ,"It was huge so tasty!!!!   it came out soon:)
The staff were very nice, I would definitely go again.

I ordered deluxe burger with cheese!!
Definitely one of the best cheeseburgers I ever ate",5,"Honolulu, HI",2021-07-22T00:00:00.000Z
hBtbkvvRLfy20rPzhGpTLw,"There's so many options to choose from! I got the mini deluxe burger with cheese and garlic fries! Food was delicious, gave us alot of ketchup, and food came out fast! They really deserve the best because of how friendly they are. Will definitely come back again :)",5,"Poway, CA",2021-05-17T00:00:00.000Z
N-K-dHmsmbLcFs0rp6scyQ,No doubt this place has the best burger that I tried by far. I got the Deluxe Burger with Garlic Fries and Milkshake perfect for a hungry stomach. The Burger has a perfectly cooked bacon with cheese and the fries were awesome. The service was great and accommodating. Will be back again soon!,5,"Boardman, OR",2021-09-16T00:00:00.000Z
cdMSbvqzTtTstYOGzCUfYw,Exactly what I was looking for!!!  Juicy bacon and blue cheese burger.  Lots of perfectly cooked onions and lots of blue cheese,5,"Sacramento, CA",2016-11-23T00:00:00.000Z
ezDpZJR2yqFm7uyMCeBk_w,"SO GOOD! (coming from a cheeseburger snob) 

Everything was great. The person that took our order was super friendly and helpful (it was our first time), and the wait time was short for the quality of the food. 

We got a deluxe burger with cheese, a mix of regular fries and sweet potato fries, and an oreo shake. Everything tasted great, but a special shout-out to the fries!!! (not the sweet potato ones, I wouldn't order those again...) The regular fries were so good! So crispy and soft! 

Chose this place because of the Yelp reviews, and glad I did. Wish I took some pictures, but I will next time!

Will def be back soon!",4,"Oakland, CA",2021-08-13T00:00:00.000Z
